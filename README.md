# N-Queen-Visualizer
# N-Queens Visualization Algorithm

A visual implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using backtracking algorithm. This program displays all possible solutions for placing N queens on an NxN chessboard where no two queens threaten each other.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of N-Queens solutions
- Speed control slider (SLOW to FAST)
- Display of all possible board configurations
- Support till 8x8 board visualization.

## Demo

The program currently demonstrates 10 unique solutions for a 5x5 chessboard, where each queen is placed such that no two queens can attack each other.

## Implementation Details

The algorithm uses backtracking to find all valid queen placements where:
- No two queens share the same row
- No two queens share the same column
- No two queens share the same diagonal

## Controls

- **Play Button**: Starts the visualization
- **Speed Slider**: Adjusts the animation speed from SLOW to FAST
- **Input Field**: Enter the number of queens (board size)

## Running the Program

Open index.html with JS support and you can run it.
